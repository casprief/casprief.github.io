								<p>As an engineer, my passion lies in the advance of technology and finding new solutions to a better and more efficient future for everyone.</p>
								<p>Nowadays, I reside happily in Augsburg, Germany, where I feel welcomed and have found a place as a productive member of their society, for what I am always really grateful.</p>

								<p>Thanks to my interest on mechatronic systems, I have been able to work up close at some of the biggest companies in the industry.</p>
								<p>For example during my Master Thesis, I was able to design an innovative movement controller for a robot manipulator, in order to achieve human-machine interaction only using the torque sensors of the robot.</p>
								<p>Since the end of my studies, I have focused more on the development of Software, taking part in important projects for research, improvement and testing of mechatronic systems.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bild9.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Born in Bogot√° (Colombia), since very little I was curious about how things work. I remember how my aunt used to bring home development kits to teach us (me and my brothers) how to create simple but amazing circuits and structures.</p>
								<p>After that my fascination for technology grew everyday, for what I invested most of my attention in the studies of mathematics and physics.</p>
								<p>I did my bachelor in Mechatronics at the <a href="http://unal.edu.co/">Universidad Nacional de Colombia</a>, where I learned a big part of my engineering knowledge. Besides, with help of a scholarship program with the DAAD, I did an exchange year at the TUM (Munich), in which I also was able to do my final work at the facilities of Audi AG.</p>
								<p>Not long after that, I successfully graduated from the <a href="http://www.eu4m.eu/inicio" target="_blank">EU4M</a> master in Mechatronics, by studying at the <a href="https://www.hs-karlsruhe.de/fk-mmt/master-mechatronik/" target="_blank">Hochschule Karlsruhe</a> and the <a href="https://www.ens2m.fr/" target="_blank">ENSMM</a>. During this time, I was able to experience the life in both Germany and France, which opened my vision of the world not only as an engineer but also as a person.</p>
